        <h2 class="header">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sorting the items in the inventory just involves clicking one of the three buttons under the table, which will cause the items to be sorted in both the table and the inventory itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#location">Where Do I Sort Items?</a></li>
            <li><a href="#sortitem">Sorting Items</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#sortname">Sorting By Name</a></li>
                <li><a href="#sortvalue">Sorting By Value</a></li>
                <li><a href="#sortserial">Sorting By Serial Number</a></li>

        <p>Under the table in the items view, there are three buttons that are used to sort the inventory. These buttons sort the inventory by name, value, and serial number respectively, and when clicked a second time, will sort the inventory in the opposite order.</p>

        <p>The methods that a user can use to sort the inventory will be explained in greater detail in the sections below. If any of these methods are used, then the items will be sorted when the inventory is exported, and will appear in the same order when imported as well.</p>
